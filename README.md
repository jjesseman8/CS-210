# CS-210

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving;**  
  The project I have choosen is the last project I completed for this course. We had to combine python with C++ to create a working program that took data from a TXT file and produced wanted outputs. These wanted outputs included the number of times a specific item was purchased on any given day and a histogram graph that showed the items purchased.   
**What did I do well and where could I enhace my code?**  
  I have a handle on how to make Python and c++ work together to make efficent code but I do feel like there where some spots in my code where I took the long route so to speak. The best way to make my code better is to not use c++ as it is not the most secure coding language to begin with.   
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**   
  The most transferable skills from this project would be the ability to mix the two languages into one working and efficent program. The other major skill the the ability to add readable inline and multiline comments to my code that makes it easier to read for others. Finally, I learned how to write the code in a secure and efficent manner which will help tremendously on future projects that I will complete for my degree and in my future career endevors.   
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**   
  I did that by adding extensive in line comments to explain what the code is and what it does. I also included reasoning why I included certain parts of code.
